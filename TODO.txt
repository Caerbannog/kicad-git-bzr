KiCad TODO List
===============

CMAKE
-----

* Add install targets for binaries and resources on Mac.
* Add Python.


Common
------
* Grep for @TODO or TODO for sourcecode tasks
* Use doxygen compatible comments on member functions (.h files)
* Add tooltip text to all non-obvious controls in every dialog window.
  Need to do this using DialogBlocks.
* Component and module search displays in which library the
  module or component lives.
* Create a better and cleaner add component and footprint dialog.
* List auto up and down scrolling.
* Toolbars and menus should be equal.
* (Main) dialog(s) title(s) should always be the same and not change over time
  when not needed. For example KiCad - <file loaded> or PCBNew - <file loaded>.
  We dont have to see which build in the titlebar. This makes documentation
  screenshots also easier. We already have the build information in the about
  dialog.
* Integer/long/double input boxes should handle comma and dot separated values,
  not only comma.
* Undo/Redo should have more steps (or could be setable).

CvPCB
-----
* Preview of the already assigned footprint.


EESchema
--------

*Improvements*
* Component add list browser with optional component preview.
* Use collector classes.
* Drag and drop between two EESchema windows.

GerbView
--------
* Need work as good as gerbv from gEDA
  * Named layers
  * List control for layer sort on the fly
* Add excellon2 drill file support (small good library)
* Fix the polygon bug.
* Switch to use ZONE instead of SEGZONE for polygons.


KiCad
-----


PCBNew
------
*BUGS*
* Backspace hotkey for deleting track segment doesn't work.
* Delete hotkey for deleting a track doesn't work.
* Fix block copy/move preview to not view only a border, we should
  see the moved/copied parts.

* Fix DIALOG_PAD_PROPERTIES_BASE class to use actual layer names in the BOARD.

* Use BOARD_ITEM::MenuIcon() in the onrightclick.cpp
* Add unroute option in rightclick menu for components
* Document specctra round tripper, and fix the english translation of help.
* Expose layer name editing. Should dove tail with net class editor from
  a UI perspective.
* Add ARC support to gerber polygons.
* Need to add polygon aperture type.
  Then example 2 in RS274xrevd_e.pdf will draw properly.
* Look at mouse auto-scroll modes (bug?)
* Add the footprint name in the automatic placement file
* Footprint list should also have a footprint preview.
