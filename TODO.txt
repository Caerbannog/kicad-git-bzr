KiCad TODO List
===============

CMAKE
-----
* Add install targets for binaries and resources on Mac.
* Add Python.

WXMAC Platform
--------------
* Fix hotkey list to match CMD key
* Fix AddHotkeyName to let wxWidgets handle Ctrl to CMD key
* Fix About dialog crash, or trash wxAboutDialog and create our own
  About dialog to match all platforms. (wxAboutDialog different on platforms)
* Fix toolbar button tooltips.

Common
------
* Grep for @TODO or TODO for sourcecode tasks
* Use doxygen compatible comments on member functions (.h files)
* Add tooltip text to all non-obvious controls in every dialog window.
  Need to do this using DialogBlocks.
* Component and module search displays in which library the
  module or component lives.
* Create a better and cleaner add component and footprint dialog.
* List auto up and down scrolling.
* Toolbars and menus should be equal.
* (Main) dialog(s) title(s) should always be the same and not change over time
  when not needed. For example KiCad - <file loaded> or PCBNew - <file loaded>.
  We dont have to see which build in the titlebar. This makes documentation
  screenshots also easier. We already have the build information in the about
  dialog.
* Integer/long/double input boxes should handle comma and dot separated values,
  not only comma.
* Undo/Redo should have more steps (or could be setable).

CvPCB
-----
* Preview of the already assigned footprint.


EESchema
--------

*Improvements*
* Component add list browser with optional component preview.
* Use collector classes.
* Drag and drop between two EESchema windows.

GerbView
--------
* Need work as good as gerbv from gEDA
  * Named layers
  * List control for layer sort on the fly
* Add excellon2 drill file support (small good library)
* Fix the polygon bug.
* Switch to use ZONE instead of SEGZONE for polygons.


KiCad
-----
Add to the Wiki what the minimum screen size resolution requirement is to run
Kicad, so that people do not try and use the program and then whine that they
cannot see everything they need.  We cannot make everyone happy, and by trying
to make those with crappy computers happy, we risk making those with high res
computers unhappy.  Establish a minimum, then ignore support complaints coming
from folks with less than that minimum.



PCBNew
------
*BUGS*
* Backspace hotkey for deleting track segment doesn't work.
* Delete hotkey for deleting a track doesn't work.
* Fix block copy/move preview to not view only a border, we should
  see the moved/copied parts.

* Fix DIALOG_PAD_PROPERTIES_BASE class to use actual layer names in the BOARD.

* Use BOARD_ITEM::MenuIcon() in the onrightclick.cpp
* Add unroute option in rightclick menu for components
* Document specctra round tripper, and fix the english translation of help.
* Expose layer name editing. Should dove tail with net class editor from
  a UI perspective.
* Add ARC support to gerber polygons.
* Need to add polygon aperture type.
  Then example 2 in RS274xrevd_e.pdf will draw properly.
* Look at mouse auto-scroll modes (bug?)
* Add the footprint name in the automatic placement file
* Footprint list should also have a footprint preview.


LAYER_WIDGET for PCBNEW
-----------------------
L1) Keyboard focus is getting stuck in layer widget and then hotkeys do not work.
    There is probably a solution to be found and it may involve asking on the
    wxWidgets mailing list.

L2) Hook in bool WinEDA_PcbFrame::LYRS::OnLayerSelect( int aLayer )

L3) When a layer changes via a hotkey, then call WinEDA_PcbFrame->m_Layers->SelectLayer()

L4) Move popup menu code from class LAYER_WIDGET into WinEDA_PcbFrame::LYRS so as
    to keep LAYER_WIDGET fully usage agnostic.  Remove #include "pcbstruct.h"      // IsValidCopperLayerIndex()
    from layer_widget.cpp.

L5) Add to moved popu menu code the ability to save the current layer widget
    color and enable settings with an additional menu item.

L6) Test, and fix up any remaining issues with the PCB_VISIBLE support, several
    items which are stored on globals could and should be stored in
    EDA_Settings.m_VisibleElements using enum PCB_VISIBLE.
