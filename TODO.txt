KiCad TODO List
===============

CMAKE
-----
* Add install targets for binaries and resources on Mac.
* Add Python.

WXMAC Platform
--------------
* Fix hotkey list to match CMD key
* Fix AddHotkeyName to let wxWidgets handle Ctrl to CMD key
* Fix About dialog crash, or trash wxAboutDialog and create our own
  About dialog to match all platforms. (wxAboutDialog different on platforms)
* Fix toolbar button tooltips.

Common
------
* Grep for @TODO or TODO for sourcecode tasks
* Use doxygen compatible comments on member functions (.h files)
* Add tooltip text to all non-obvious controls in every dialog window.
  Need to do this using DialogBlocks.
* Component and module search displays in which library the
  module or component lives.
* List auto up and down scrolling.
* Integer/long/double input boxes should handle comma and dot separated values,
  not only comma.

CvPCB
-----
* Preview of the already assigned footprint.


EESchema
--------
* Use collector classes.
* Drag and drop between two EESchema windows.

GerbView
--------
* Need work as good as gerbv from gEDA
  * Named layers
  * List control for layer sort on the fly
* Add excellon2 drill file support (small good library)
* Fix the polygon bug.
* Switch to use ZONE instead of SEGZONE for polygons.


KiCad
-----
Add to the Wiki what the minimum screen size resolution requirement is to run
Kicad, so that people do not try and use the program and then whine that they
cannot see everything they need.  We cannot make everyone happy, and by trying
to make those with crappy computers happy, we risk making those with high res
computers unhappy.  Establish a minimum, then ignore support complaints coming
from folks with less than that minimum.



PCBNew
------
P0) JP Charras:
    We should need to separate color handling from visibility handling:
    Visibilty variables nus be owned by the current board.
    (Modedit and Board editor must have separate visibility options:
     Modedit should have always all items and layers visibles)
    Colors options must be left global
    (Modedit and Board editor must have common color options)

P1) Fix the color box which shows which layer is selected, or change tool tip.
    It is not tracking layer changes.  Look into WinEDA_PcbFrame::syncLayerBox(),
    which is probably where fix should go.
    >> JP Charras: For me this is now working.

Dick:
P2) Write accessors for all items in PCB_VISIBLE such as grid control, so that
    the write accessor can fire change notifications to known listeners.
    (Accessors should always be used in general for every class, but in the case
    of PCB_VISIBLE I think we need them in WinEDA_PcbFrame, BOARD and
    EDA_Settings.
    <class>::IsElementVisible( aPCB_VISIBLE );
    <class>::SetElementVisiblity( aPCB_VISIBLE, bool isVisible );
    Two of the 3 classes already have these functions.  Once the functions are
    in place, it is a simple matter to decide and move where the actual data
    is stored without affecting client code.  The top most access point should
    be WinEDA_PcbVisible, because some data is best retained there and this is
    the "controller" part of MVC in PCBNEW.  Some data is best saved in the BOARD.
    We should go through the list of PCB_VISIBLE and decide on this in a separate email.

*   Fix block copy/move preview to not view only a border, we should
    see the moved/copied parts.

*   Fix DIALOG_PAD_PROPERTIES_BASE class to use actual layer names in the BOARD.

*   Use BOARD_ITEM::MenuIcon() in the onrightclick.cpp
*   Document specctra round tripper, and fix the english translation of help.
*   Add ARC support to gerber polygons.
*   Need to add polygon aperture type.
    Then example 2 in RS274xrevd_e.pdf will draw properly.


Dick:
D1) Get the nested quote support for DSNLEXER fixed up and committed.


LAYER_WIDGET for PCBNEW (Dick)
-----------------------
L6) Test, and fix up any remaining issues with the PCB_VISIBLE support after P2)
    is done.  This way we can fire change notifications to multiple GUI items
    all interested in the same setting, such as the two grid buttons which
    have to remain synchronized.  Using accessors makes this easy.

L7) make the bitmapbutton a staticbitmap, and make its size dependent on
    the point size.

L8) LAYER_WIDGET::GetBestSize() needs platform independence.

L9) On board load, ReFill() is called, this should also update the Render
    checkboxes and colors.  Will need to extend the widget API.

L10)still thinking about background colors, easier now without wxformbuilder.
