Here are some source code maintenance tasks that need to be done, and maybe some
folks will see these items and volunteer to do them.


*** Look at gerbview/block.cpp for text:
// @todo: bug? memory leak at this point:  about line 418
this definitely looks like a memory leak.

*** footprint_text_xpm is included more than once into the link image of pcbnew.

*** @todo: grep for @todo and finish off those tasks.


*** make the ADD_MENUITEM macros in include/macros.h be static inline functions instead
of macros.  e.g. w/o argument types:
static inline void ADD_MENUITEM(menu, id, text, icon)
{
    wxMenuItem * l_item;
    l_item = new wxMenuItem(menu, id, text);
    l_item->SetBitmap(icon); menu->Append(l_item);
}


*** Set up a DOXYGEN environment starting with a configuration file that:
- understands the JavaDoc style comments that we have started using
- gives preference to comments in header files over *.cpp files
- outputs its HTML stuff relative to the base of trunk, say for example trunk/doxygen
- is then added to the svn repository (this configuration file only) 
Then add a shell script and batch file to generate the docs using the config file.
Then review the generated docs and start to go through the source and make the 
generated doxygen docs readable and clear using the JavaDoc style comments,
mostly in the header files.  The error and warning output of the doxygen
compiler can help with this too.


*** Translate comments that are in French to English so there can be a broader
understanding by new developers.

*** Implement the graying in/out of "Edit/Undo", "Edit/Redo" menu items, 
when Undo/Redo stack is empty/filled.
