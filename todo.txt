Here are some source code maintenance tasks that need to be done, and maybe some
folks will see these items and volunteer to do them.


*** @todo: grep for @todo and finish off those tasks, scattered throughout the source.


*** use BOARD_ITEM::MenuIcon() in the onrightclick.cpp


*** Use DOXYGEN compatible comments on member functions.  As configured,
Doxygen gives priority to comments in header files over *.cpp files.
Review the generated docs and start to go through the source and make the
generated doxygen docs readable and clear using the JavaDoc style comments,
mostly in the header files.  The error and warning output of the doxygen
compiler can help with this too.


*** Translate comments that are in French to English so there can be a broader
understanding by new developers.


*** Add tooltip text to all non-obvious controls in every dialog window.
Need to do this using DialogBlocks.

1) Gerbview needs to work at least as well as gerv, that means adding named layers,
   and a list control to sort the layer stack on the fly.  There seems to be a polygon bug
   of some kind, don't know how long that's been in there.  (Dick)
2) Add net class support to PCBNEW, so the round tripping to freerouter
   is a dream (Dick)
3) Document the specctra round tripper, and fix up the english translation
   of help.  (Dick, native english speaker)
4) Expose layer name editing in pcbnew (anyone), should dove tail with net
   class editor from a UI perspective.

specctra:
Add net class support to pcbnew so that the export to specctra becomes richer.
A netclass should hold a list of nets, track width, track spacing,
via drill size and via copper diameter.

+pcbnew
    When picking new board from the menu, when an existing board is already
    in memory, the number of layers in the new board is not set to the default
    but rather to the number of layers in the previously loaded board, and with
    the default layer names, rather than the layer names of the previously
    loaded board.   I think the number of layers should be reduced to the
    default and the default layer names should be used.
