Here are some source code maintenance tasks that need to be done, and maybe some
folks will see these items and volunteer to do them.



*** Look at @todo in editrack-part2.cpp.  Is this is a bug?  ** Done (JP Charras)  **
Concerns:
a) Isn't there a problem with losing the memory of the original?
b) If this is supposed to duplicate a SEGVIA to, then this call should be changed
   to the new TRACK::Copy(), i.e. g_CurrentTrackSegment->Copy() 
>> (JP Charras:) No problem. the code is correct.
	I have put comments to explain this code section and modified some line for a more intelligible code


   
*** Set up a DOXYGEN environment starting with a configuration file that:
- understands the JavaDoc style comments that we have started using
- gives preference to comments in header files over *.cpp files
- outputs its HTML stuff relative to the base of trunk, say for example trunk/doxygen
- is then added to the svn repository (this configuration file only) 
Then add a shell script and batch file to generate the docs using the config file.
Then review the generated docs and start to go through the source and make the 
generated doxygen docs readable and clear using the JavaDoc style comments,
mostly in the header files.  The error and warning output of the doxygen
compiler can help with this too.


*** Translate comments that are in French to English so there can be a broader
understanding by new developers.
