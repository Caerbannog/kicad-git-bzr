== Spaces and Tabs ==

Try to use as many as can TABS instead of spaces, this makes indenting
much more easy.


== Function prototypes ==

The name of the function should be on a seperated line, this for easy
 searching in long source files.
Each parameter should use a own line, aligned under the first parameter.
Below there is an example, this style is for reading and editing quick trough
sourcecode. Also indenting can be set with a good programmers editor
(visual spaces per tab, this because one tab is normaly 8 spaces on screen)

Example:

void
foo( int x,
     int y,
     int z )
{
	function1();

	if(var == 1)
	{
		dothis();
		dothat();
	}
}
