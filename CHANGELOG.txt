2010-Jan-21 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Integration of LAYER_WIDGET into WinEDA_PcbFrame.  See
    TODO.txt for more things that need to be done.


2010-Jan-17 UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <xor.gate.engineering[at]gmail[dot]com>
================================================================================
More work to make kicad more Mac OS X compliant.
* Workaround for wxAboutDialog bug.
* WXMAC needs wxID_EXIT to make closing the application function properly.
* Workaround for hotkeys, on Mac OS X we can't use Fx keys.
  This needs to be further implemented and is a work in progress.
  We need to modify the hotkey code to display Mac OS X the
  special modifier keys in the hotkey list.


2010-Jan-18 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++any
    Finished up complete implementation of class LAYER_WIDGET and am now ready to
    integrate it into PCBNEW.  This class was kept as general as possible by
    omitting as many Kicad document structures as possible, and so can be used
    in GERBVIEW.  For GERBVIEW it could benefit from some minor additional
    work such as a "move up" function for layer order changes.  This is a matter
    of rearranging wxWindows within the m_LayersFlexGridSizer.
    Integration into PCBNEW should be done in just a few days.


2010-Jan-17 UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <xor.gate.engineering[at]gmail[dot]com>
================================================================================
+ EESchema
 + Added Torsten Huter's patch for hotkeys
 + Moved recent opened documents to submenu

+ Pcbnew
 + Big (re)organisation of pcbframe menubar and cleanup

2010-Jan-13 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
Minor bug fixes, compiler warning fixes and code cleaning.

* Fix debug asserts when passing NULL pointers to wxAuiPaneInfo.
* Fix Kicad main window sash sizer bug when using wxAui.
* Remove specctra_test from Visual Studio builds to prevent build errors.
* Add WIN32 to layer widget test so it will build properly on Visual Studio.
* Fixed compiler conversion warnings in PCBNew.
* Fixed worksheet print scaling in PCBNew.
* Minor code renaming.

2010-Jan-12 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All
    Use wxAutoBufferedPaintDC in OnPaint event
    Seems solves slow grid redraw on some PC (tested under Window 7)
    and is faster than use wxPaintDC, not buffered
    (note MACOSX has natively a double buffer, so no change for MACOSX)

2010-Jan-08 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Gerbview
    Added support of arcs in polygons outlines.
    Needed to show copper areas in some gerber files
    Not fully tested but works better than without this support...


2010-Jan-03 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    - fixed a potential bug in a fill zone function: AddClearanceAreasPolygonsToPolysList()
    - Try to fix a problem with AddClearanceAreasPolygonsToPolysList() under Window Vista and Window 7
      This is perhaps a problem in kbool library
      (a bug in Bool_Engine destructor ?)
      It happens when:
      - a lot of polygon corners are added in group A
      - nothing in group B
      - No operation asked in kbool engine ( that also has a bug if an operation is asked
        with no polygon in group B)
      - and call the Bool_Engine destructor.
      Could be a stack error or overflow, very hard to locate and debug.
      - Under Vista seems create always a crash.
      - Under Window 7 sometimes create a crash.
      - No problem under XP and Linux.
    -Workaround:
      Leave the group A void if group B is void.
      I am not sure this change fix the problem.
      Just it solves this problem with 2 samples boards that crash Pcbnew without this change.

2010-Jan-01 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Rewrite plot dialog using wxDialogBlocks.
    Display layers list according to the Setup layers dialog order.
++Gerbview
    Write Gerbview plot dialog using wxDialogBlocks.
    Do not use anymore the Pcbnew one.
