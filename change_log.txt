2007-Aug-19 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ all
  * Made BASE_SCREEN::m_CurrentItem private so we can force usage of the new 
    SetCurItem() function, and use it to put a breakpoint on the only place
    that m_CurrentItem is changed, namely in the new SetCurItem() function.  
    ( Added new function GetCurItem() as well to class BASE_SCREEN in 
    drawpanel_wxstruct.h.)  Using a stack trace at the breakpoint we can tell 
    who called it.  There were in excess of 450 edits to get this done so I
    had to commit it asap so other folks could get on with edits without a 
    merge conflict.
  * Started work on the COLLECTOR class which will assist in giving a choice
    in PCBNEW when there is more than one click candidate at the same mouse
    or cursor coordinates.  COLLECTOR not committed yet.
  * More beautification.
  * The mouse click and part synchronization from EESCHEMA to PCBNEW would 
    track fine but would not always position the PCBNEW part on screen.  Now
    we center it unconditionally.  No change was made in the reverse direction
    since that code uses the long established Find support.
    

2007-Aug-14 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ eeschema & pcbnew
  * Added mouse click, TCP/IP socket based,  part synchronization in the reverse 
    of how it was working, so a mouse click on a module in PCBNEW will take 
    EESCHEMA to the part with the same reference.
  * More beautification, working with developer of uncrustify.  Almost ready
    to add the customized uncrustifiy configuration file to this project.
  * Fixed a bug in pcbnew/tracepcb.cpp's WinEDA_PcbFrame::Trace_Pcb( wxDC* DC, int mode )
    which was using a bool for the MaskLay variable, causing through hole pads
    on modules on copper layer not to be shown when the copper components were
    set to invisible.
    

2007-aug-11 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+ eeschema
    modify hotkeys.cpp code.

    
2007-Aug-10 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew & common
    Improved MODULE::FindPadOrModule().
    Ran more source files through auto-beautifier.
    Renamed dupltrac.cpp to dupltrac.cpp.notused.

    
2007-aug-10 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+ eeschema
    better hotkeys.cpp code.


2007-Aug-09 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew & common
    Released the new Visitor paradigm.   Wrote MODULE::FindPadOrModule() using
    it.


2007-aug-09 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+ eeschema
    Some new hotkeys (see hotkeys.cpp).
    Now, the key ? display the current existing hotkeys


2007-Aug-08 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew & common
  * Renamed locate.cpp's distance() to DistanceTest() and moved it to trigo.cpp.
    Pass more parameters to DistanceTest and removed globals that were used by 
    distance() in locate.cpp.  
    Moved and renamed DistanceTest function proto from protos.h to trigo.h.
  * Implemented HitTest() for class_cotation, class_mire, and a few other classes
    by factoring out existing code from locate.cpp.  locate.cpp should operate
    exactly the same as before.
  * Improved or implemented the Show() function for several classes.
  * Detected that the suspected class_module hit-testing bug was not real, 
    i.e. no bug found.
  

2007-aug-08 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+ eeschema
    bug in class_hierarchy_sheet.cpp.

+ pcbnew
    small change in block commands:
        rastnest was updated for each footprint, while moving footprints.
        Now it is updated at the end of changes.
    enhancements in block.cpp and connect.cpp
    

2007-Aug-07 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew & common
  * More searching work.  Made HitTest() virtual.  Factored out a HitTest() 
    function for both class_module and class_pad from existing code.  
  * Embellished the Show() function for several of the classes.  Could be the
    basis of a possible future XML export, but with the native format being
    ascii already, this is of questionable value as an export.
  * Discovered a long time existing bug in class_module hit-testing. 
    Still need to understand it. It could just be an improperly formatted module.


2007-Aug-06 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew & common
    Started sketching out a new search architecture.  To learn more:
    look for "INSPECTOR" text in base_struct.h. 
    

2007-Aug-05 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew & common
  * Added some conditional DEBUG code for showing the pcb object tree in 
    simple XML format.   See class EDA_BaseStruct's new Show() function.
  * Changed the function name of Locate( const wxPoint& ref_pos ) to bool HitTest(..)
    in both class_text_mod and base_struct.
  * More beautification and commenting.


2007-Aug-04 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    Read-ability formatting, I am playing with a C++ beautifier called "uncrustify".
        I had to patch it and spent 2 days getting it configured.  Patch not 
        sent upstream yet.
    Fixed a bug in "display local ratsnest pad or module": if you had a small
        module and the mouse clicked its reference text, the ratnest for 
        the associated module would not show.  The work around was to add
        support to Show_1_Ratsnest() so it could take a TYPETEXTEMODULE as
        the result of the hit-testing.  But I think a longer term better
        solution will be to create a specific search function for this kind
        of hit-testing, one which could disregard text and look only for
        pads and modules.


2007-aug-02 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    Drc test now generates a DRC file report.


2007-Jul-31 UPDATE   Geoff Harland <gharlandau@yahoo.com.au>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    Drill Map and Drill Report files now list the diameters of each drill in
    the selected drill unit first, and then in the other drill unit.
    Drill report files also now list the tool assigned to each drill, and
    the correct hole count and oval count for each drill size; the
    file creation date and the selected drill unit are also listed.
    

2007-Jul-30 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    Some file are added (missing .prj files)
    Better Drc test:
        Zones can be tested.
        better pad to pad test.
    

2007-Jul-25 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
    ** Some minor enhancements
+ pcbnew
    In Drc diags, better (more explicit) messages
    Change (and simplify) code in  'update' as well as 'insert' modules into main PCB from within the module editor,
    because it had a bug (crashes when there was no footprint in pcb)
    


2007-June-21 UPDATE Tim Hanson <tim@hardcarve.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    1. added button to 'update' as well as 'insert' modules into main PCB 
        from within the module editor.  Made them functional, of course. 
    2. added control-o, control-s & control-f to pcbnew, 
        though I'm not perfectly happy with the implementation -- wxwidgets puts
        the control-characters in alphabetical order!

        
2007-June-25 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    minor enhancement in Edit footprint dialog (more help tool tips).
    better hotkey.cpp (code cleaning and info messages)


2007-June-19 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dickelbeck@yahoo.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    After locking a module with 'L', update the status window with the locked
    status.  Side step some asserts from wxWidgets which were happening when
    running compiled for debug.


2007-June-16 UPDATE   Richard A Burton <richardaburton@gmail.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    fix debug assert starting pcbnew with wx2.6
+ build
    add install targets for resources and docs

    
2007-June-15 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dickelbeck@yahoo.com>
================================================================================
+ pcbnew
    **  only modules on the present layer are subject to individual module
        moves, rotations, or layer swaps, with the 'M', 'G', 'R' or 'S' hotkeys.
    **  only unlocked modules are subject to the individual module moves,
        rotations, or layer swaps, with the 'M', 'G', 'R' or 'S' hotkeys.
    **  implemented the 'L' hotkey to quickly lock or unlock a module,
        just by hovering over it and hitting the 'L' or 'l' key. The lock is
        toggled.
    **  Enhanced locate.cpp's Locate_Prefered_Module(BOARD * Pcb, int typeloc)
        significantly, it now has a widely ranging behavior based on the 
        typeloc argument.
    

2007-June-14 UPDATE Igor Plyatov <plyatov@mail.ru>
================================================================================
+ eeschema
    Added sorting by value or position in to the annotation window 
    (Thanks for patch to Andrey Fedorushkov).

================================================================================
+ build:
    dynamic linking by default, use make -f makefile.gtk KICAD_STATIC_LINK=1
    or uncomment the bit in libs.linux for static


2007-June-11 UPDATE   Richard A Burton <richardaburton@gmail.com>
================================================================================
+ build:
    removed several 2 line scripts for configuring wx builds and put them in
    how-to-build-kicad.txt
    improved KICAD_STATIC_LINK handling so it can be overridden on the command
    line e.g. "make -f makefile.gtk KICAD_STATIC_LINK=0"
